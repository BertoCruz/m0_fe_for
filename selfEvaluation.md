# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
**_RESPONSE:_** I feel very confident in being able to navigate the for statement. I was reminded that I would need to do research on my own to figure out the even-odds question. so it felt good to back and forth between atom and google to test things out, as well as doing background check and looking up details on the % operator.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
**_RESPONSE:_** I felt the productive struggle, and that was to play around with the way i word my google searches. this was an expansive reminder.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
**_RESPONSE:_** I would like to start looking into ways in which I can evolve and grow on the For statement. learn the many ways that this statement is most effective, what situations it is most effective in.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
**_RESPONSE:_** I want to learn about nested for loops.
